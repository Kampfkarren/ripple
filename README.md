# ðŸŽ¨ Motion

**Motion** is a simple, lightweight, and easy-to-use Roblox library for creating simple transitions and animations. It is inspired by [roact-spring](https://github.com/chriscerie/roact-spring) and is primarily intended to be a general-use alternative to [Flipper](https://github.com/Reselim/Flipper) for [Roblox-TS](https://roblox-ts.com).

You may use Motion with or without Roact. Currently, there is no package for using Motion with Roact.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

Motion is available on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rbxts/motion) and can be installed with the following commands:

```bash
npm install @rbxts/motion
