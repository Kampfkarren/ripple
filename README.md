# ðŸŽ¨ Ripple

**Ripple** is a simple, lightweight, and easy-to-use Roblox library for creating simple transitions and animations. It is inspired by [roact-spring](https://github.com/chriscerie/roact-spring) and is primarily intended to be a general-use alternative to [Flipper](https://github.com/Reselim/Flipper) for [Roblox-TS](https://roblox-ts.com).

You may use Ripple with or without Roact. Currently, there is no package for using Ripple with Roact.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

```bash
